## Lights Out
Welcome to lights out! Lights out is a puzzle that was created by Tiger Electronics in 1995. The game consists of a 5x5 grid where each square is 
randomly assigned to either white or black (light on or off). The goal of the game is to turn all of the squares white using a toggle rule where a 
selected square and all of the squares orthogonally adjacent to it flip colors. This implementation of the game allows the user to play lights out on either a 3x3,
5x5, and 10x10 grid. It also provide the user with a solver for the game if they get stuck! The solver uses a algorithm I developed, with a little help from linear alegbra, 
to find a solution to the game. The solver works for all three grid sizes provided. Happy solving!
